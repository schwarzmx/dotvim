I'm a vim newbie. I code primarily in MacVim but I also use gvim on an Ubuntu box.

I decided to keep history of my .vimrc config and will be adding stuff in this repository
as I discover more features of this awesome editor.

To use this repository:

    1. clone the repository to ~/.vim
    2. symlink your .vimrc to ~/.vim/vimrc with the following command:
        ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc .vimrc


Have fun coding!
