I'm a vim newbie. I code primarily in MacVim but I also use gvim on an Ubuntu box.

I decided to keep history of my .vimrc config and will be adding stuff in this repository
as I discover more features of this awesome editor.

To use this repository:

    1. clone the repository to ~/.vim with: `git clone git@github.com:schwarzmx/dotvim.git ~/.vim`
    2. Create the symbolic links to the .vim folder with the following command: `./install.sh`

Have fun coding!
