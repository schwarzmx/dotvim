I'm a vim newbie. I code primarily in MacVim but I also use gvim on an Ubuntu box.

I decided to keep history of my .vimrc config and will be adding stuff in this repository
as I discover more features of this awesome editor.

To use this repository:

1. clone the repository to ~/.vim with:
        git clone git@github.com:schwarzmx/dotvim.git ~/.vim
2. Create the symbolic links to the .vim folder with the following command:
        ./install.sh

Have fun coding!
